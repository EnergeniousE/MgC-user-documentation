# Introduction to MgC

**MicrogridCreator** is a powerful and easy-to-use microgrid simulation and optimization engine. It helps developers and end users plan, design, and optimize complex sector-coupled decentralized energy systems. MgC is a cloud-based service that can run independently of the end-user's device. The MgC tool holds immense potential for designing efficient and resilient microgrid systems, enabling optimized energy management and sustainable power distribution.

### Advantages

1. ### Simple and ease-of-use

In 4 steps to your goal:

* Define the framework of your system
* Set the goal of your optimization
* Run the simulation
* Analyze the results

2. **Data visualization & export**

The extensive visualization features give you a quick overview of the most important parameters and optimization results.

* Both the technical and the economic key figures can be recorded as time series data and summary overviews.
* Export the data in the format you need for integration into your workflow.

Seeing what matters at a glance saves you a lot of time and effort.

3. **Work flexibility**
