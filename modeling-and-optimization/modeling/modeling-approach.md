<summary>Decision and operation related variables</summary>

**Continuous variables:** in the context of mathematical optimization, are numerical values that can take any real number within a specified range. They provide a wide spectrum of possibilities and are used to represent parameters like capacity, efficiency, and performance characteristics in microgrid design.

**Integers+Binaries:** In microgrid modeling, they are used to depict quantities, such as the number of units of a particular component or the on/off state of a device.

In the MgC tool, the inclusion of continuous variables allows for precise adjustment of parameters like the capacity of energy sources or the efficiency of storage systems. Integers and binaries are utilized to control discrete aspects, such as deciding how many units of a specific component to include in the microgrid or whether a particular component is activated (1) or deactivated (0).

This combination of variable types in MgC enhances the flexibility and granularity of microgrid design, enabling users to make detailed and optimized decisions while considering both continuous and discrete factors.

<summary>Constraints + Boundaries</summary>

In microgrid modeling, constraints, and boundaries are critical limitations that guide technical design and operation. They encompass factors such as physical specifications, operational restrictions, and safety requirements, ensuring that the microgrid operates within defined parameters.

**Technical design constraints:** These constraints restrict the microgrid's design based on physical and operational characteristics, such as the maximum capacity of components, voltage limits, and temperature thresholds. MgC incorporates these limitations to maintain compliance with technical specifications.

**Operational constraints:** Operational constraints define how the microgrid functions, accounting for factors like load demands and energy source availability. MgC considers these constraints to ensure effective microgrid operation within operational boundaries.

**Safety and regulatory boundaries:** These boundaries encompass legal and safety requirements, including environmental standards and regulatory policies. MgC adheres to these boundaries to guarantee microgrid designs and operations align with safety and compliance standards.

As shown in the below graph, It begins with linear programming, represented in grey, and then seamlessly transitions to integer programming, illustrating feasible solutions with black dots on the x and y axes. The next step involves plotting user-specified objective planes, and pinpointing the exact intersection point where two lines meet. This point of convergence, closely matching the user's objective, is highlighted as a blue line in the graph below.&#x20;
