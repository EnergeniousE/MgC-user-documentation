# Modeling and Optimization

MgC offers users the ability to create highly detailed energy network models. It employs a capable sophisticated solver to efficiently address complex building models. The iterative simulation feature allows precise fine-tuning by exchanging information in-between the building blocks, aligning the microgrid design with the user's objectives for optimized and efficient energy solutions.
