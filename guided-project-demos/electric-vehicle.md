# Electric vehicle

Concept:

Microgrid networks integrate EVs as dynamic energy assets. They serve as both energy consumers and mobile storage units, charging during off-peak hours and discharging during peak demand. This feature optimizes energy usage, enhances grid stability, and facilitates the integration of renewable energy sources.

The EV Integration module within the MgC facilitates the seamless incorporation of EVs into microgrid networks. Users can easily create and manage EV elements within their microgrid setups, optimizing energy usage and grid stability. Leveraging EVs as flexible energy assets, users can optimize grid stability and energy usage patterns. By harnessing the potential of EVs, users can enhance the sustainability and efficiency of their microgrid systems using MgC.
