# Branch creation and setup

**Branch creation** in microgrids establishes connections between hubs, ensuring efficient energy flow, enhancing reliability, and enabling load balancing. It's a fundamental element for optimizing energy distribution and control in microgrid systems.

To create a new branch from the default hub to the second hub, the **"New Branch"** option should be clicked on, located on the right top side beside the **"New Hub"** creation option. Following this, the origin hub and target hub can be selected by utilizing the dropdown option. Subsequently, the desired domain can be chosen from the domain options panel, as depicted in the image below.

Upon the selection of origin and target hubs, along with the chosen domains, the branch length will be automatically calculated by MgC's built-in algorithms, and the new branch creation request can be submitted by specifying the branch name, transmission efficiency, and rated temperature, especially when the heating domain is chosen, as indicated in the image below.

The creation of the new branch is completed, displaying pertinent information on the right side of the MgC layout, as illustrated in the image below.
