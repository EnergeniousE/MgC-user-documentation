# Project setup and simulation

Project setup and simulation in the MgC involve the following key steps:

**Project setup:**

1. **Initialization:** A new project is created, providing project details like name, location, and weather data.
2. **System design:** Configure the microgrid layout, establish hubs, define energy sources, and set up loads and technologies.
3. **Resource configuration:** Specify energy sources, consumption, and technological parameters for accuracy in simulations.
4. **Financial parameters:** Include financial data, such as consumer electricity prices and feed-in tariffs, for cost analysis.

**Simulation:**

1. **Simulation start:** Initiate simulations by clicking "Start Simulation" within the "Actions" feature.
2. **Control and adjustment:** Observe microgrid performance under different conditions, adjust parameters, and run multiple simulations for optimization.
3. **Results analysis:** Explore the "Results" section for insights into energy flows, costs, and environmental impacts.
4. **Export and documentation:** Export simulation results as PDF reports for documentation and sharing.

MgC simplifies project setup and simulation, aiding efficient microgrid design and performance evaluation.
