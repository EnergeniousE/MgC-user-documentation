# Project setup and simulation

Project setup and simulation in the MgC involve the following key steps:

**Project Setup:**

1. **Initialization:** A new project is created, providing project details like name, location, and weather data.
2. **System Design:** Configure the microgrid layout, establish hubs, define energy sources, and set up loads and technologies.
3. **Resource Configuration:** Specify energy sources, consumption, and technological parameters for accuracy in simulations.
4. **Financial Parameters:** Include financial data, such as consumer electricity prices and feed-in tariffs, for cost analysis.

**Simulation:**

1. **Simulation Start:** Initiate simulations by clicking "Start Simulation" within the "Actions" feature.
2. **Control and Adjustment:** Observe microgrid performance under different conditions, adjust parameters, and run multiple simulations for optimization.
3. **Results Analysis:** Explore the "Results" section for insights into energy flows, costs, and environmental impacts.
4. **Export and Documentation:** Export simulation results as PDF reports for documentation and sharing.

MgC simplifies project setup and simulation, aiding efficient microgrid design and performance evaluation.
