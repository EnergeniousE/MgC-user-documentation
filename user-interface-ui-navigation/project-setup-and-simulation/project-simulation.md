# Project simulation

After the inputs for resources, loads, and technologies have been meticulously entered, and the project has been securely saved, the simulation process can be initiated. This is achieved by selecting the **"Start Simulation"** option within the actions feature, followed by clicking on the **"Submit"** option. This process ensures a professional and systematic approach to monitoring and analyzing the project's performance.
