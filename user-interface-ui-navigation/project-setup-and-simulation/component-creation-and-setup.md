# Component creation and setup

The creation of components in the domains of MgC is initiated by selecting the **'Network'** option under the 'System Design' feature. The design of the network, incorporating various equipment and loads, can be seamlessly achieved within the **electricity, heating, and cooling domains**, as demonstrated in the illustration below. On the right side of the layout, a comprehensive display of the **loads, technologies, and resources** utilized in the network's domains will be displayed. These intriguing features of MgC can be explored with a simple click on the 'Network' option.

**Component creation**

Prescribed components and user-generated components in the selected template are depicted in a vivid color, while uncreated components are rendered in a pale shade.

To generate a new component within the network, just **click on the uncreated component**, and **provide the necessary details** for project simulation.

**Details input**

To ensure proper template simulation in the project, the **component details** should be furnished, including the **element name and the data source.** The data can be retrieved from the default initialization or accessed from the [library](https://mgc.energenious.net/library) with ease, highlighting MgC's distinctive feature of providing flexibility in selecting the necessary inputs for the component.&#x20;

After the details have been provided, the element can be created by selecting the 'Add Element' option, or if further information is deemed necessary, the 'Add Element' and 'Edit' options can be chosen.

**Component Parameters and specifications**

After the component is created in the network, the _**basic parameters, financial information, and specifications, including technical, economic, and environmental details**_, can be viewed and edited. This feature distinguishes MgC as a tool for designing reliable network components.

<summary><strong>Specifications</strong></summary>

The importance of specifications lies in their ability to provide precise details and guidelines for the design, operation, and evaluation of components or systems, ensuring that they meet the desired technical, economic, and environmental criteria.

1. _**Techncial Specifications**_

The technical specifications feature details key aspects, including energy supply, energy conversion efficiency as a %, and the maximum downward and upward power constraint gradients per hour.

2. _**Economic Specifications**_

The importance of economic specifications lies in their ability to provide a comprehensive financial overview, encompassing both initial investment _**(CAPEX)**_ and ongoing operational costs _**(OPEX)**_, including fixed and variable expenses associated with component operation. This level of financial detail is essential for precise project cost analysis and decision-making.

The uniqueness of MgC lies in its capacity to seamlessly integrate and analyze these economic specifications, offering users a holistic view of their microgrid projects, enabling informed financial planning, and ultimately ensuring cost-effective and sustainable solutions.

3. _**Environmental Specifications**_

Similarly, environmental specifications play a crucial role in assessing the ecological impact of a component. It encompass parameters related to _**GHG emissions during manufacturing**_ in CO2 equivalent providing valuable insights into the environmental implications of microgrid components and their operation.

_**Adding loads in the domain network**_

To include new loads in the domain, just select 'Add New Instance,' input the element name, choose the default hub for energy sourcing, and specify the data source for the load's name. A simple click on 'Add Element' will seamlessly integrate the load into the network domain, highlighting MgC's user-friendly functionality.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the user needs to add and edit the load or component, then simply click on "Add Element and Edit".
{% endhint %}
