# Hub creation and setup

They enable seamless coordination between renewable energy sources, such as solar panels or wind turbines, and various loads, like buildings or industrial facilities, ensuring reliable and resilient energy supply. By monitoring and regulating energy flow, hubs contribute to reducing grid dependencies and enhancing overall system performance in microgrid applications.

**Hubs:** The process of creating new hubs in a microgrid project is streamlined, and a step-by-step guide is as follows:

1. **Accessing system design:** To begin, access the "System Design" feature on the left side of the MgC interface.
2. **Default hub:** A default hub will be already in place, and created when the project was initiated.
3. **Creating new hubs:** To expand the microgrid by adding more hubs, navigate to the "Hubs" section, also located on the right side of the MgC layout.
4. **Initiating creation:** Within the "Hubs" section, locate and click on the "Create New Hub" option.

Following these steps, the process of creating new hubs is facilitated, enhancing the microgrid's capacity and control for efficient energy management.

To create the hub, begin by **clicking on the desired location** on the MgC layout map. Then the location data of the hub will be displayed in the popup. Next, **enter the hub's name** into the designated name box, and finally, submit the information to complete the hub creation process.

After submitting the hub creation request, the hub will be created and the relevant information about the hubs will be shown on the right side of the MgC layout as shown in the below image.
