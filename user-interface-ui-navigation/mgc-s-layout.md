**Advanced features**

In MgC, a variety of advanced features are offered within the **Resources, Loads, and Technologies** section, allowing users to seamlessly add or access information related to the features they have created, thereby simplifying the process of managing their microgrid project with ease and precision.

In the Resources section, users have the ability to edit the resources of energy to the loads, the commodities such as electricity, natural gas, hydrogen and fuel cells used in the resources, and financial resources like Feed-In tariff, PPA and grants at their discretion, presenting an intriguing feature that allows for precise simulation and enhanced flexibility within the MgC. This data plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate cost analysis and precise simulation capabilities within MgC.
